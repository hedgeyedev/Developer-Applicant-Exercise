Refactoring notes
 - Added input checking with errors, just in case someone tries to call it with the wrong types/values
 - Left the altcode creation alone, could have inserted '-' and substring'ed, but it seemed like a fine way to do it
 - Used gsub with regex and mapping, much cleaner and readable, should also handle multiple occurences.
   Also allows for easier expansion in the future, could even be made dynamic
