This refactoring example is a ruby port of a refactoring exercise from
_Extreme Programming Explored_. template.rb taken from the the Ruby
refactoring code https://github.com/kevinrutherford/rrwb-code

Refactoring Notes for template file:

1. Code Smell: Duplicated Code - The original template method contained repetitive code for replacing placeholders.

2. Applied Refactoring: I applied the "Extract Method" refactoring by using Ruby's `gsub` method to replace placeholders in a single line, eliminating the need for duplicating the string manipulation logic.

3. Reason for Refactoring: This change was made to adhere to the DRY principle, thereby improving code maintainability and readability.

4. Result: The refactored code is more concise and easier to understand. It also reduces the risk of errors that could arise from repeated code sections.

Refactoring Notes for Spec File:

1. Original Issues: The initial spec file lacked descriptive context and used inline setup within the test, making it harder to understand at a glance.

2. Applied Refactoring: Introduced `context` and `let` blocks for better structuring of the test. Improved the `it` block description to clearly state the expected behavior.

3. Reason for Changes: These changes were made to align with RSpec best practices, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the test. Using `context` helps organize tests logically, and `let` makes setup more concise and clear.

4. Result: The refactored spec file is now more readable and maintainable. It's easier for other developers to understand the purpose of each test and modify or add new tests as needed.
