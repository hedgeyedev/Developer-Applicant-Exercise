1) No need to convert a string into a string

  template = String.new(source_template)

2) The rest of this is just two substitutions, which is best handled with gsub!

2a) The first substitution is trivial because we already have the value

2b) The second substitution requires calculating the altcode, a task that belongs in a separate function

3) We're really done already, but to be thorough, I threw in a test of the new altcode function

4) You could even make the template function a single line by chaining the gsub! calls, but I think it's easier to read this way
