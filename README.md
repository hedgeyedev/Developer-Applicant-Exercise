# Web Developer Applicant Exercise

To be considered for a developer position at [Hedgeye](http://www2.hedgeye.com), you must successfully complete these steps [**](#footnote)

**Please note:** your code will be tested on Ruby 1.9.2.  If we need a browser to test, it will be the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and/or Safari.

1. Fork this repository
2. In the *why_hire_me* directory
    * Add a file `cover_letter.txt` with cover letter type verbiage.
    * Add a file that describes one of your preferred development tools (editor, desktop app, etc.) and why you use it 
    * Fill out the questionnaire.txt
    * Anything else we should know
3. In the *simple_refactoring_exercise* directory you will find some Ruby code that needs to be refactored.
    * An rspec spec is provided
    * Please [refactor](http://www.refactoring.com) the implementation
    * Please note: feel free to change the specs, but they should all be passing when you turn in your code.
    * Leave a note what you refactored and why.  Smells and specific refactorings are good.
4. In the *simple_public_timeline* directory, please create a simple (Ruby Framework of your choice, (suggestion: Sinatra is good for a tiny app like this)) web app that looks close to the middle column in logged out state of http://twitter.com/public_timeline
    * A headline with "Recent Public Tweets"
    * A smaller headline "What everyone on Twitter is talking about"
    * Displays 20 entries from twitter's public timeline.  Use the data/API of your choice
        * For each entry, show:
            * image profile on the left
            * a "stack" on the right including a link to the users profile, followed by the tweet text on the same line.  Below that the relative time of the tweet (i.e. 1 minute ago) and source attribution (i.e. "via Twitter for Android")
            * Barebones style ok.  No need for nice css, text wrapping, but bonus if you do it.
    * Required
        * `.rvmrc` and `Gemfile`
        * at least 1 spec
    * Optional (Extra Credit)
        * Comprehensive specs
        * More/Nicer Styling
        * More things that look like the original
5. Commit and Push your code to your fork
6. Send a pull request, we will review your code and get back to you.  If your GitHub profile does not include your name, please include your name in the pull request.

job application task was previously done by [Integrum](http://integrumtech.com) [here](https://github.com/integrum/job-application)
