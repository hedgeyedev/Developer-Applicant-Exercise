# Web Developer Applicant Exercise

## Read Me First
1. I used https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ instead of Twitter API since Twitter API requires paid tier for fetching tweets.
    - Twitter API v1 is opened only for media upload, help, rate limit, and login with Twitter.
    - Twitter API v2 is opened to free tier only for Tweet creation.
    - You can see here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api
2. I don't have experience with RSpec, and due to time constraints, I wasn't able to familiarize myself with it adequately. So, I have not been able to include API tests using RSpec in this work. However, I really want to learn it and I will learn it in near future.
