# Some items of note

1. In order for the application to work, the `.env` file must be populated with twitter credentials
2. I have included a Makefile to get things going. To perform initial setup type `make`. To run the service type `make run`. To run tests type `make test`
3. It appears that twitter has significantly locked down their API so I was unable to access a general tweet stream. Instead, I used codewisdom.
