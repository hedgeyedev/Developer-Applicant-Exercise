Dear HedgeEye,

Thank you for the opportunity to consider myself for a developer position.  I have been programming in different roles for
the past 4 years.  Before that I was a Cost/Price Analyst at Parker Hannifin.  I have a passion for technology and love
programming and had an opportunity to switch to being a programmer and took it.  After six months of work on a successful software
implementation the company asked me to stay on as IT Manager. In that role I kept developing software, but I also was
responsible for managing all internal software and applications.

As we steadily pushed new features out to the system I experimented with creating a simple api and added rails
applications for new features instead of adding more customizations to the ERP System.  I was initially inspired by the
simplicity of Rails and how close to natural language the code could look.  I later realized what I loved so much about
rails was the power and expressiveness you could achieve with Ruby.

I believe my passion for coding and technology and my past experience will make me a great fit.  Can't wait to talk more
about this position and see if my skills and personality make a good fit.

Sincerely,

Drew Purdy
