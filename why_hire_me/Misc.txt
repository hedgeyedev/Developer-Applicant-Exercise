Pref development tools:

Visual Studio for anything Microsoft. Like the layout and I have used it since v1 (old habit).

Dreamweaver for plain web. Love their CSS, JS views. Hate the preview. CS6 version is very buggy. 

Whatever text editor I can get my hands on for on the fly stuff.

Coda for iPad is great.

Photoshop for graphics.
