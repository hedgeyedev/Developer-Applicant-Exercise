Hi!
As you know, my name is Paolo Insogna.
I'm 29 years old and I come from Campobasso, Italy.
I got both my bachelor and masters degree in Computer Engineering at University of Rome "Tor Vergata" in 2006 and 2009.
Developing and web-designing is my favorite hobby and I'm really passionate about that. I have 10+ years of experience in web designing (yes, I fought really hard with IE 6) and 5+ years of experience in Ruby and Ruby on Rails development.
Besided programming I love videogames, table and live role playing, soccer and several other things. Also, I'm a espresso coffee maniac. Really. Get used to it.
Hope to hear from you soon!
Regards,
  Paolo
