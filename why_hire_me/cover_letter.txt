Hello Hedgeye Team,

I am a web developer with experience in Ruby (Rails) and JavaScript
(jQuery, Backbone), an MBA with a focus in Entrepreneurship, and a BS in
Biology. I am looking to join a team that solves interesting problems,
fosters continued learning, and has fun while they are doing it. What
interests me about joining the Hedgeye team is the opportunity to work
in an agile environment that values TDD/BDD. I also value the
opportunity to work on all different aspects of the business and
development while making a larger impact on the company.

I have  experience in both front-end (CSS, HTML, JS) and backend
(Rails, SQL) development. One of current my projects is a daily product
digest of fitness and health products curated by its users, called
Health Hunt (inspired by Product Hunt). Health Hunt is built with a
Backbone front-end consuming a RESTful Rails JSON API. I used custom
AJAX requests to create product voting and user following. I also
created custom modals and forms to improve UI/UX while browsing. The app
  fosters a community of users to curate interesting products and
collections through daily posts and comments.

Additional information on my background and projects are in my resume
and can be viewed on my portfolio page(http://www.tparesi.com). Please
let me know if you have any questions, and I look forward to hearing
from you.


All the Best,


Thomas G Paresi
