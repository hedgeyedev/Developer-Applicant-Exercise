With 23 years of building rock-solid web-based solutions across diverse business domains,
I'm thrilled to express my keen interest in the Senior Software Engineer position at Hedgeye.

With over a decade of mastering Ruby on Rails, I bring a comprehensive understanding of its
intricacies and best practices. My expertise spans from architecting scalable systems to optimizing 
performance and ensuring code maintainability. Leadership comes naturally to me. I thrive in
mentoring junior developers, fostering knowledge sharing, and taking ownership of technical decisions
that drive project success. Throughout my career, I've embraced challenges in diverse environments,
quickly grasping new domain knowledge and integrating seamlessly into new teams. This adaptability
ensures I can hit the ground running and make immediate contributions.

I'm impressed by Hedgeye's commitment to enabling individuals to have more insight into
their financial decisions. My desire to contribute to building innovative solutions that enable
folks to create their own financial security aligns with the theme of empowerment that Hedgeye 
seems to foster.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I'm eager to learn more about this exciting opportunity
and discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your continued success.
