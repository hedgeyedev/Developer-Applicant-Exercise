Hello,


My name is Eric Kurzenberger, and I am currently employed by Yale University as a Software Engineer, where I design, develop and deploy Ruby on Rails web applications using SCRUM and Agile planning methodologies and Behavior- and Test-Driven development.  I’ve been a Rails developer for over 3 years and have shipped a number of products which are currently in active production, covering areas such as e-commerce, data management, event planning, and personnel administration.

For your perusal, my resume (resume.md) can be found in this directory.

If you have any questions or would just like to chat, please don’t hesitate to contact me.


Cheers,


Eric
