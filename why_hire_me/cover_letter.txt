Dear Mr. Chang,

I have 10 years of professional web development experience. From my first role, I have always been thrown into the deep end, learning on the job. I have picked up many skills this way, and have thrived in a variety of work environments. Because of this background, I am a strong asset in situations where the tasks are varied and/or unknown.

I am looking for a position where I can hone my craft as a programmer. I am looking for a team that requires me to become a better programmer every day. I am looking for a job where the quality of my work is a priority to my team, and company growth is a product of my team's work quality.

Thank you for considering me to be a part of your team. I have known Brett for a while now (our wives are good friends from college), and I would be honored to be able to work with him. He had a strong influence on my early professional growth and I have always held him in great respect as a programmer and as a person.

I look forward to speaking with you!

Abe Millett
