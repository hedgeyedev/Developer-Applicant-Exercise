Dear Hiring Manager:

I am seeking for a position as a Rails developer that will challenge me and help me grow as a developer.

In my current position I have been working as a full stack Rails developer for over 5 years. There I have developed and deployed several custom sales and item costing reporting tools that are used on a daly basis by the sales and operations staff on a daily basis for quick, accurate data.

I am a self-starter and self motivating, always looking for ways to improve my current and past projects by improving UX and adding features. I would love to be challenged by scaling issues and other technology issues you donâ€™t come across when your user base is only a few dozen users.

Sincerely,

Timothy Neems
