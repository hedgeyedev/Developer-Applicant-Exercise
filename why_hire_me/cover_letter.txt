Problem Solver, Experience Creator, Code Wrangler

Dear Hiring Manager,

I have always been an engineer.

As a curious four-year-old, I eagerly disassembled my first microwave, and by the age of nine, I was taking apart the dining room table just moments before Thanksgiving dinner was served. While my aspirations as a carpenter may have evolved, my passion for engineering remains steadfast.

For me, being a software developer transcends mere occupation; it's a vehicle for turning dreams into daily realities. Hedgeye, with its innovative product and commitment to creating exceptional experiences, perfectly aligns with my vision.

Allow me to elucidate how I can be an invaluable asset to Hedgeye.

As an accomplished Software Engineer, I bring over 15 years of hands-on experience in software development to the table. My previous role at Charles Schwab entrusted me with the responsibility of designing and crafting scalable software solutions, optimizing business processes, and enhancing efficiency. My technical prowess spans Java, Python, SQL, JavaScript, and a variety of software development tools and platforms.

One of my proudest accomplishments was spearheading a team of developers in conceiving and launching a groundbreaking software product that now manages over $1 trillion in assets. The thrill of innovation and the challenge of solving complex problems fuel my enthusiasm for the role at Hedgeye.

Thank you for considering my application. I eagerly welcome the opportunity to delve further into my qualifications and Hedgeye the synergy between my skills and the Software Engineer position at Hedgeye.

I look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
Philip Leesha
