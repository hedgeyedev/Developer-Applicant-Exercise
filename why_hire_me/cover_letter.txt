Hello Hedgeye!

I am applying for the role of Full Stack Software Engineer and would like to explain why I am a good fit
for the role. Having been in web development for the last eight years, and as a Ruby on Rails developer 
for the last four, I have experience in feature development, project planning and design, and code 
deployments. The team I worked on produced many features including an Email Drip Campaign that allowed our
customers to craft a series of related emails that would reach thousands of their potential candidates at 
given intervals. This allowed our customers to not have to manage their candidate outreach so closely and 
ensure they were reaching the right candidates at the right time.

Our team also went through several upgrades for Ruby and Rails which required significant refactoring. We also 
migrated our databases from MySql to Postgres and eventually from Postgres to AWS RDS. Working on a small team 
developing eight Rails applications provided with not just development experience, but also hosting and devops. 
Whether it was refactoring microservices and their service wrappers, deploying EC2 instances to the cloud, or
rewriting our deployment scripts, I found myself wearing several hats.

I'd like to thank you for considering me for the role of Full Stack Software Engineer and look forward to 
hearing from you.
