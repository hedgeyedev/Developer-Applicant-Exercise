Dear Hedgeye,

I have accumulated extensive expertise in software development across diverse industries. As a Principal Engineer at Bertram Labs from 2014 to 2023, I spearheaded projects for both portfolio companies and internal incubation projects, specializing in technologies such as Java, Groovy, Swift, Objective-C, JSP, JavaScript, MySQL, MSSQL, and cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. I have also served as a Senior Software Engineer at Spireon, Android Lead at Life360, Senior Mobile Architect at YouMail, Inc., and Senior Java Developer at Cie Studios, each role contributing to my multifaceted skill set.

With respect to the role of Full-Stack Engineer I am confident that I can step in and hit the ground running in relatively short order.

Sincerely,
William Chu
