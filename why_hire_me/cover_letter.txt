To whom it may concern:

I am interested in the programming internship. I am currently employed as a Design Automation Engineer for TowerJazz Semiconductor. I accepted this position because of the emphasis on the coding and research skills which are applicable to your requirements for a programming internship. My experience at TowerJazz has afforded me the opportunity to become familiar with Unix and Perl. I also have extensive education in engineering.

In my position as Design Automation Engineer for TowerJazz, I verify computer environments for integrated circuit design software.

In response to your search for an intern, I believe my experience at TowerJazz, and my research and coding skills qualify me for consideration.

Sincerely, 

Zach Rabinovich
