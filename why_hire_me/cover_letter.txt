I have been coding in web frameworks for 6 years, starting out in .NET
and then moving to rails 3 years ago.  During that time I have become
proficient across the stack, but my focus lately has been on the front
end and feature development, as well as performance tuning.  I have
become a go to person on my team for things test related, and thing
relating to our backbone.js front-end.  I am active in our ruby and
javascript meetups, I recently wrote a jquery widget, and plan to
continue my open source involvment through blogging.  If you have any
questions, please let me know,

Appreciatevly,

James Mac William
