To whom it may concern,

My name is Don Humphreys, and I am very interested in the Software Engineer position open at Hedgeye. I am an experienced full stack Rails developer with a passion for code quality and reusability. I currently work in an Agile development environment with strict weekly iterations. My team releases minimum viable products quickly while constantly delivering enhancements until project completion. Test-driven development, remote pair programming, continuous integration, and code reviews are all important parts of efficient work flow for me. I am a hard worker who is always finding ways to improve, but I also enjoy having fun and learning with my peers. I believe my work ethic, extensive technical background, and communication skills make me an excellent fit for this position.

I have broad experience with many languages and a heavy focus in web technologies. Ruby is my favorite language, and the MVC pattern especially appeals to me. I pushed my former ColdFusion company to develop in an MVC framework when Rails was still in its early stages. Through open source development, I explored the deep internals of Rails and consider myself an expert. Now I focus heavily on implementing Rails best practices developed by companies such as Thoughtbot. I often mentor other developers in data architecture, code quality, RSpec unit testing, reusability, single responsibility, and other topics.

My back-end skills reach to the server level. I am a Linux hobbyist that has been called upon many times to perform system administration tasks. I have configured and supported deployment strategies using Heroku, AWS, Docker, CircleCI, and bare metal servers. Developing and consuming REST APIs with XML and JSON are also commonplace for me. I have extensive data architecture and query optimization experience in multiple RDBMS including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. Git is by far my favorite DSCM tool, and I generally won't touch code until it is under some form of source control.

My front-end skills are equally sharp. I often joke that I learned CSS "in the trenches" when browsers such as IE 5.5 were common. In recent years, I have focused on responsive design and user experience by creating applications that scale without sacrificing functionality. SASS and frameworks such as Bourbon have made this job much easier. I have even written Android wrappers to bring responsive web applications directly to mobile devices. My scripting skills are also strong. I can code in pure JavaScript, jQuery, and AngularJS very efficiently. In all of my front-end solutions, I emphasize clean code, reusability, maintainability, and graceful degradation.

Besides this deep technical background, I am an analytical thinker often praised for my problem solving and business acumen. But above all, I am a hard worker who is committed to delivering quality software. I hope that I turn out to be a great fit for this position. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Don Humphreys
