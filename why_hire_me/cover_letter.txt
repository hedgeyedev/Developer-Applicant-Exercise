I am interested in the senior web engineer role opening at Hedgeye.

Since 2005 I have been working professionally as a full-stack web developer using several
frameworks to deliver a variety of performant web applications. I have led small teams to develop
large, customer-facing applications in a scalable and maintainable fashion. I am proficient in a
variety of programming/scripting languages and development patterns/methodologies

My experience developing large web applications will enable me to fill the senior web engineer role
and immediately start contributing. I will follow up with you next week, and you can contact
me at (206) 395-9592 or scott@buffbit.com. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Sincerely,
Scott Moore
