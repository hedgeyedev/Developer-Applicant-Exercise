My name is Sean Robenalt, and I'm a motivated software engineer. I began learning software via an online bootcamp late 2016. 
I got my first job a year later working for a YCombinator backed startup called Forever Labs. I was the only software engineer, 
so I had to learn things on the fly. It was a great start to my career, and I liked that I got thrown into the mix in a fast-moving 
startup so I could learn quick. Shortly after that, I began working on a side-project with a friend called FixMyCar. He consulted me 
to build software for his mobile mechanic business, allowing users to go through a few steps on a website to get matched with a nearby 
mechanic. We started working on the software, and cut to a year later we get $250k from an independent angel. We used that to 
continue working on the side. We hired some employees and remote devs, and worked on it all 2020 in our free time. We closed a 
$1.6M pre-seed round early this year and then I joined full-time there. We've since built out most of the foundation for everything, 
and now it's in a place where I can explore other options since I am not needed as much as I was in the first few years. I love software,
and love to write code. I'm very happy I got into this craft, and look forward to finding the next opportunity that will allow me to 
challenge myself and learn new things.
