Dear Mr. Chang,

I am applying for your Web Engineer position.  I was referred to this position through whitetruffle.com, and like the agile predisposition the company has.

I think my Ruby on Rails background, as well as my agile experience working in a small startup will make me an excellent match for your company.  I think my strong upbeat attitude and work ethic will serve me well on any of your teams.

Thank you, I look forward to hearing from you

-Ryan
