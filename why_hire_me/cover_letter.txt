Dear Hedgeye:

I am excited to be applying for your Web Developer Internship. In browsing internship opportunities
online, I was delighted to find such a great opportunity so close to home, both literally, and more
importantly in terms of my interests and skills.

The experience I have being a part of, and leading, my FIRST Tech Challenge robotics team has done a
 lot to prepare me to work on a development team, and I think it also fits the Agile Development
 environment particularly well. The nature of the competition meant that we often had little time
 in-between tournaments, where we had to turn around frequent updates to software, while also
 maintaining a high level of reliability and reproducibility. And coordination between the hardware
 and software priorities was essential. Under this stress, I learned first-hand the importance of
 thoughtful software design, good abstraction, and best practices, and have developed high personal
 standards for my code.

Through my studies of Ruby and web technologies in High School, now my studies of Computer Science
 theory at college, and all the while my independent projects, I have gained the skills to take on
 a wide variety of programming challenges. Plus, my experience developing web applications is
 significant. While most of them were learning projects, there were several that served a purpose,
 and made it to production. Some examples include the website for my robotics team, and the web- and
 app-based schedule system to which I contributed a great deal of the backend code, which is still
 widely used amongst the 2,000 or so students of my High School.

My various experiences were all fueled by a great passion for technology. I canâ€™t wait to apply that
 passion to doing web development at Hedgeye. Thank you for considering my application. I eagerly
 await your reply.

Sincerely,
Alex Davis
