Hello, Hedgeye:

I believe you should hire me because:

* I'm a quality Ruby/Rails/JavaScript/JQuery programmer
* My knowledge and skills are steadily improving, and I'm constantly buying/reading books, watching videos, and coding new things
* I have strong knowledge of the database layer
* I love programming and am committed to the craft and to writing clean, maintainable code
* I'm a clear thinker and good communicator
* I listen well
* I speak up when I believe I have something important to say
* I have experience in academic research and Internet product management
* I have an economics Ph.D. and some finance and statistical knowledge, which would help me understand the problem domain
* I have programmed in R, even generating charts like you use on Hedgeye.com

--James
