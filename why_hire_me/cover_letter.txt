Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Renaldo Pierre-Louis. I was an Engineer Intern at Hedgeye Risk Management LLC this past summer (2012), and I would like to say that I enjoyed my time at Hedgeye immensely and thank you for seeing the potential in me and giving me a chance.  I learnt a lot and derived great satisfaction from knowing that my work was valued. Everyone treated me as one of them and I felt like part of a family and therefore I would like to launch my career at Hedgeye.

I believe that my skills and expertise would be a great addition to the Engineering team at Hedgeye. If there are any areas in which I still need improvement, I can guarantee that catching up would not take long as I am a fast learner, and always ready to learn about new technology. I am confident that my background and knowledge in the Information Technology arena coupled with my strong problem solving skills will prove an asset to Hedgeye and add immediate value to this company.

If I can provide you with any information to facilitate your hiring decision, please let me know.

Thank You!
Sincerely, 
Renaldo Pierre-Louis
