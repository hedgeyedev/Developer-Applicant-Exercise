Hello Hedgeye!

Thanks for reviewing my developer exercise submission.

I realize I'm quite new to Ruby and Rails, but JavaScript is my specialty.
I have a lot of experience building interactive UI in JavaScript, TypeScript,
and new experience working with JS inside of Rails.

I'm a big fan of Hedgeye and bring a lot to the table in terms of JS, UI,
interactivity, and data visualization. 

Thanks again for the opportunity to submit some code. 

Cheers,
John
