Dear Hiring Manager,

I am seeking a position as a full-stack developer. I feel that my ability to program in a variety of languages and my experience in a fast-paced environment make me the ideal fit for this position.

I excel in an environment that requires quick thinking and responsiveness. My ability to communicate clearly and effectively with members of my team allows me to be agile, while still creating quality work. I value the knowledge and guidance my colleagues can give, but I understand when it is necessary to take the lead on a project and vocalize my ideas. I  am comfortable working with clients face-to-face, and I enjoy exploring new and creative ways to meet their needs. I value deadlines, but as a true perfectionist I look for opportunities to grow my abilities and knowledge, and improve upon my skillset. I am not satisfied with  what will do; I strive for what is best.

I appreciate your time, and look forward to speaking with you about the opportunity. 

Best,
Brett Novak
