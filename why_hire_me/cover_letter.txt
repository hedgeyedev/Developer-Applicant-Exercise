Voicing an unpopular opinion can be a difficult and daunting task. While I do believe that it is important to apply some tact, there are situations where I believe it is better to get straight to the point and rip off the band aid. With any technology project, there comes technical debt. Technical debt means to not address and/or solve the root cause but to just put a patch (temporary fix) due to numerous constraints such as schedule, budget, manpower, etc.

Through my career as an Software engineer, I have never shyed away from a challenge and been afraid to voice a concern that points or addresses the big elephant in the room. Retrospectives, (Agile process where team discusses what went well and areas of improvement) I suggested a somewhat extreme measure of stopping any new feature work and addressing technical debt. Provided case studies of other companies that did this and are now more agile and able to meet customer needs of features and quality in a timely manner. I did get some shocked looks, but I clarified that I wanted to get the conversation started of addressing our product's technical debt. This led to good discussion which led to follow up meetings with stakeholders where different perspectives were weighed. Even though the opinion was unpopular and/or unheard of in the beginning the numbers and case studies convinced everyone that something needed to be done. We were able to come up with a compromise of spending 20% of each engineer's time addressing technical debt in our product. After this exercise, not only did team morale but also our velocity to deliver new features drastically increased all while maintaining or improving quality.

In addition to my technical background and skills, I strive to develop and improve my people and interpersonal skills as well. I have experience being a team leader working with/managing volunteers at a local hospital. This opportunity allowed me to build upon the qualities required to be a good leader especially when dealing with people from different educational and non-technical backgrounds. These experiences have directly translated to my technical leadership success of working with executives to build out strategic and technical roadmaps and guide, plan work for, review, and mentor engineers on my team, which have been senior and junior engineers, interns, and contractors, to enable us to deliver results for our users and the business.
