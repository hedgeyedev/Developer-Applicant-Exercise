To Whom It May Concern:

This letter is meant to express my interest in discussing the Software Developer position at Hedgeye. This opportunity is intriguing to me because I feel that it defines a perfect blend of my past experience, and what I would like to obtain for my future experience. I believe that I can be a strong asset to the company.

The key strengths I possess for success in this position include:

- I have been exposed to an Agile world before. I understand the concepts of TDD/BDD, and my previous employment opportunities included continuous integration.
- My current technical knowledge has been mostly obtained through my ambition. I have a tendency to spend many hours of my freetime playing with new technology, just so that I can share the latest and greatest with my colleagues.
- My love for Ruby started with my days at Fidessa, and since then it has never stoped reshaping itself.
- I'm fasinated with the Web Development world, and it is a dream of mine to become a rockstar developer in this environment.
- I love to code in VIM, as a matter of fact this cover letter is written using VIM.

My education includes a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from Virginia Commonwealth Univeristy. It has been many years since college, however I've never ceased to learn new things. I also have experience in the financial industry which includes but is not limited to:

- Customer service and support
- Pair Programming

- Process improvement and documentation

It is my hope that Hedeye takes into consideration my candidacy. I have confidence that if I join the team, my skills will be an asset to Hedge.
