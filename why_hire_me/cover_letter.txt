I started making websites when I was 13 years old and I have never looked back.
Today, I bring in over 15 years of experience to the online field, Iâ€™ve built a wide array of solutions, 
ranging from import scripts and data scraper to high end websites and SaaS applications. 
I am passionate about what I do and I bring that passion and dedication to the projects I choose to work on.
