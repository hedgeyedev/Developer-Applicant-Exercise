/-- What are your opinions on Agile software development? --/

System used to track human performance, break up a huge projects into tasks, scheduled meetings with scheduled questions, overall necessary to manage work in a virtual space

/-- TDD or BDD? --/

Both, great to use BDD to think about the details of implementation and organize a bunch of lower-level tests into a higher-level feature.

Although, sometimes when a project is in a brainstorm period and you just want the most basic TDD to quickly bring MVP to market and ensure that new features are not breaking others.
