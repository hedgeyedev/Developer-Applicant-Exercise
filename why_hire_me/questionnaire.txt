What are your opinions on Agile software development?
The first time i have heard of Agile was on the phone with Forrest during 
our phone interview. I have done a lot of research and found the idea to be amazing, 
Have a pair of engineers work on a single project not only improves efficiency, it also acts like a built in redundant safety system. What excites me the most is that it makes learning that much easier.  

TDD or BDD?
I think booth systems have their own distinct advantages.
