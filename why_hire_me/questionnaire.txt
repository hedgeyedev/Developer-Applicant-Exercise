What are your opinions on Agile software development?
I think Agile development has proven to be one of the most successful patterns to software development in the past 5 years.  My journey from accounting to software development started with working on a project with Thoughtworks where I learned and saw how well this methodology worked.  I've been using it to varying degrees in my own work and ever since.
