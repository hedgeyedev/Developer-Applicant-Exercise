What are your opinions on Agile software development?
I prefer the advantages that the Agile methodology offers in constant iteration. The regular cadence of standups encourages me to reset and focus on what have I done, what I plan on doing and any blocker(s) that might be preventing me from progresing forward. Likewise at the group level I have found it helpful to encourage communication and collaboration. The phrase "Inch by inch" comes to mind.

TDD or BDD?
If I had to choose between the two then I would choose BDD because I view BDD as encompassing TDD. I equate TDD as unit and integration tests and BDD with functional tests and satisfying acceptance criteria.

What are your preferred development tools?
My preferred development tools depends on the project. In most cases I prefer an IDE for code completion and the option to debug. When it comes to bash scripting and IaC I prefer Sublime Text. I prefer Intellij over Eclipse for Java/Groovy/Vue development. XCode for iOS/tvOS development but there really isn't a choice to be made per se. For Typescript and React Native I prefer Visual Studio Code.
