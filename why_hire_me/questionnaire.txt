How many years of Web development experience do you have?

10 years.  I built my first site while interning for an architecture company.  The next summer I went to Idaho and worked full time on PHP/MySQL sites for local companies, I've come a long way since then.

How many years of JavaScript experience do you have?

6 years.  While I'd relied on JavaScript for small things like image swapping, the first project I made use of AJAX, a JavaScript library, Google Maps api, and true UI improvements, was in 2006.  Thankfully, the month before the project started, Duke decided to stop requiring IE 4 & 5 support.

What are your opinions on Agile software development?

I think it is a really healthy way to work.  I've seen it implemented in a few variations, but I think for success it needs two things:
	1. Everyone who influences, effects, or interacts with the development team needs to commit to the process, know how to write a story, and be committed to upholding their role.
	2. Everyone needs to buy into the process for more reasons than it being the magic bullet of developer super productivity.  In my previous position I championed an agile development process, including pair programming.  I found the less measurable benefits far outweighed any productivity gain; we wrote better code, we became better estimators, we upheld our definition of done, we had shared understanding of our codebases, and had great growth in individuals' skillsets.

TDD or BDD?

I am surprised the commit for this question dosen't have a flame war going in the comments :)  I guess I am a BDD fan.  Honestly though, I can only paint in broad strokes the differences between the two.  I like RSpec, I like the mindset the language puts you in, and I like that a well-written RSpec test suite documents what the purpose of a method or a class is.  At the end of the day, I want a test methodology that ensures good coverage, is easy to implement, promotes good code, and documents a developer's intentions.

What are you looking for in a job?

I want to be part of a team, challenged, valued, and in the long term feel that I am having a net benefit on the world.  I also want to laugh a few times a day.

Are you legal to work in the US?

Yes.

When can you start?

We should arrive in New Haven the 13th/14th, but for purposes of settling in I'd not want to start before the 18th.
