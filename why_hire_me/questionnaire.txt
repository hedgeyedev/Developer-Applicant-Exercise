What are your opinions on Agile software development?
  It's a really powerful technique for developing in a fast and effective pace, especially when compared to big-company complex documentation analysis way to develop. The only thing is to try to stick to the roadmap and not to switch context too often.

TDD or BDD?
  Both, of course. :) But TDD may be more appropriate on the short term.

What are you looking for in a job?
  I'm looking for a dynamic workplace, flat hierarchy structure and interesting problems to solve daily. Oh, and a good compensation! ;)
  
Are you legal to work in the US?
  I'm currently under H1B visa until Sep 2015, so a H1B transfer will be needed.

When can you start?
  As said earlier, as soon USCIS allows me to do that. I need to give two weeks earlier notice to the employer but I think visa transfer will be longer.
