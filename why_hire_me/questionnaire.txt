What are your opinions on Agile software development?
It's a great development framework that facilitates communication between product and engineering and
allows for the team to effectively plan what to take on. It breaks down the work into manageable sprints,
which are groomed and planned by the whole team (Product, Engineering, QA) and allows for folks to meet daily
to discuss concerns or blockers that are impeding development. It also provides team members with opportunities
to decide what and how much work to take on, which provides development with a sustainable workload.

TDD or BDD?
Both, Behavior Driven Development ensures external stakeholders and product are being heard and getting what they need.
Test Driven Development takes the requirements of the stakeholders and implements them to ensure the feature delivers what was intended

What are you looking for in a job?
I'm looking for a company that is invested in the products they sell as well as the people they employ. I'd 
love to work as a part of a team that is ruby centric and is building out new features for their products.
