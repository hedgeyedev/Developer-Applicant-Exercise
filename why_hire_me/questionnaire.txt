What are your opinions on Agile software development?
Far superior to waterfall, especially when the needs of the client are dynamic.
Allows for better cross-functionality of team members and ability to more effectively plan work.
I have experience working with both scrum and kanban, however I tend to prefer scrum as the
iterations provide a better benchmark for tracking progress in my opinion.

TDD or BDD?
My current position uses BDD, and I also prefer it. BDD ensures that the core functionality that
the client wants is understood by the team and product owner,
as well as validated as part of the definition of done.
TDD can be very effective for backend work, but is more difficult to implement for front end features in comparison
from my experience.
When I work on backend stories, I prefer to implement TDD for myself even though it is not required by my team, as it gets
me to think about and plan the design before I start coding. This tends to lead to cleaner and more precise code, as well as a 
more efficient development process for myself.

What are you looking for in a job?
A few different things. Competitive compensation, experienced team members who can provide constructive criticism and advice
for me to improve both as an engineer and a person, a product focused position, opportunity for advancement and an environment
that is not too stressful and conducive to learning. I love working hard and learning new things, it is my passion.

Are you legal to work in the US?
