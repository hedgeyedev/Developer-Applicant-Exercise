How many years of Web development experience do you have?
- about 10 years


How many years of JavaScript experience do you have?
- about 10 years; I would say I was comfortable with JavaScript after my first professional year so more like 9 years in reality.


How many years of Ruby experience do you have?
- 0; I have dabbled (I have a few very small sites out there using Middleman) but no professional experience or paying clients.


How many years of Rails development experience do you have?
- 0; I have set up one or two tutorial projects in the past but no more than that


What are your opinions on Agile software development?
- I don't have a very strong opinion, but I believe that the concept of sprints is an effective and natural way to structure work effort.


TDD or BDD?
- I have generally used a BDD approach in the past (though I haven't worked on a pure Agile team). At my current job we are finding that a major weakness is our lack of formalized testing, so I am increasingly aware of the advantages of TDD.


What are you looking for in a job?
- I want to be challenged. I want an environment where personal skill growth is linked with team/company growth. My personal temperament inclines towards broad vs deep knowledge, so I am a stronger asset in an environment where the tasks are varied and/or unknown. That said, my general goal is to hone my programming craft, so I am focused on deepening my general skills as applied to any software stack (learning about the functional paradigm and the Lisp lineage has opened my mind to the idea that programming is not merely syntax). An ideal job is one where good code is important, and there are real problems to be solved.


Are you legal to work in the US?
- yes


When can you start?
- any time + notice (approx. 2 weeks)


Additional:
- I have grown to really hate working on Windows. I can do it (I've been working with .NET and csharp sites for a while now), but I really don't like it. I started tinkering with Linux before I was employed as a web developer, and while I worked on Windows initially, my second job required a mac which worked out well. Lately, I am exploring the possibility of using OpenBSD as a daily workstation. Suffice to say, I can operate in any environment required of me, but given the choice I will go with a native *nix.
- Several years ago, in a fit of unreasonableness, I learned vim. I have been using Visual Studio at work for a while now, and it feels like trying to swim through molasses. Recently (while learning about Lisp), I felt some jealousy for emacs, so I have been trying Emacs Doom. I am not sure if it will stick, although I have really been enjoying it for the most part.
- Ideally, I want to have a job with *nix-only workflows, where I can refine my personal commandline workflows. Currently I have a few scripts that help me work within WSL, but I really want to use *nix full-time professionally and continue building up a good set of personal tools.
- I really enjoy approaching tasks from the perspective of the potential user. I think the most interesting work is done at the edges, where the interfaces are.
- I don't mind talking to clients, I actually often find myself enjoying the challenge.
- I am a competent designer. I view graphic design as no different from any interface design. It's all just identifying goals, and engineering solutions to reach those goals.
