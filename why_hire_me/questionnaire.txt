What are your opinions on Agile software development?
I was doing Java when the Xtreme Programming movement was
happening and I always loved the pragmatic, developer led
process part of it. The culture of automated testing that
it upholds is really great and in general I think it
empowers developers. Over the years the ideas have gone
through changes so I think it's important to stick to the
spirit of tight communication loops with people via regular
touch points or with code via constant testing.

TDD or BDD?
I don't really see them as two things to be compared. I feel like the
philosophy of BDD helps organize my approach to TDD. Many times when I'm on a
green field feature I'll kick things off in a TDD way with a test but
the test itself starts with just comments describing the "given x, when y, then z"
BDD approach.

What are you looking for in a job?
Looking to join a solid team that build each other up and have

financial goals either through enterprise or in this case with direct
financial tool support.
