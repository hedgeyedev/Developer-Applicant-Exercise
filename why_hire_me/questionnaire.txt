What are your opinions on Agile software development?
- I don't have a very strong opinion, but I believe that the concept of sprints is an effective and natural way to structure work effort.


TDD or BDD?
- I have generally used a BDD approach in the past (though I haven't worked on a pure Agile team). At my current job we are finding that a major weakness is our lack of formalized testing, so I am increasingly aware of the advantages of TDD.


What are you looking for in a job?
- I want to be challenged. I want an environment where personal skill growth is linked with team/company growth. My personal temperament inclines towards broad vs deep knowledge, so I am a stronger asset in an environment where the tasks are varied and/or unknown. That said, my general goal is to hone my programming craft, so I am focused on deepening my general skills as applied to any software stack (learning about the functional paradigm and the Lisp lineage has opened my mind to the idea that programming is not merely syntax). An ideal job is one where good code is important, and there are real problems to be solved.
