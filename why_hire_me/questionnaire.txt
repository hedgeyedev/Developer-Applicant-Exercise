Editor of choice and other desktop apps?

My editor of choice is Visual Studio Code. I appreciate its extensive range of extensions which significantly enhance and expedite the development process. Additionally, features like integrated terminals, GitLens, and customizable themes contribute to its efficiency and user-friendliness, making it an indispensable tool in my development toolkit.

In addition to my preferred development tool, VSCode, I also regularly use the TradingView platform for market analysis. My experience extends to coding in TradingView's Pine Script editor, where I've developed custom scripts for market analysis and trading strategies. This aligns with my interest in the financial markets and complements my technical skills as a software developer. It showcases my ability to apply software development principles in diverse contexts, including trading and investment analysis, which I believe could be beneficial in a role that intersects with the financial markets.
