What are your opinions on Agile software development?
Any methodology is a tool to help you generate high quality software.  There are aspects of Agile practices that I have
heavily used in my career and

TDD or BDD?
I don't really understand the value add from BDD.  It seems like yet another attempt to ensure that stakeholders and
developers are aligned.  Given the opportunity cost there better ways IMHO that investing heavily in BDD versus other
activities.  However since I don't have any experience with it I am happy to be convinced of its efficacy.
