What are your opinions on Agile software development?

"One size, does not fit all." I am a fan of kahnban but scrum has been more the "to-go" choice for most teams.
I find that for smaller teams, a hybrid model works well.

TDD or BDD?

Good question. This is also dependent on the team. For backend only work, TDD is a solid approach. BDD is a great
way to test out full stack applications, if the test suite is setup and configured correctly. I work on limited
teams that had a proper BDD setup.
