How many years of Web development experience do you have?

Considering breaks, I've been working with dynamic languages for about 6 cumulative years. I began web development at the age of 12 (I'm 21 now), mainly tinkering/modifying php scripts/applications. I would describe myself during early teenage years as a "script kiddie". This taught me to appreciate the beauty that is ruby/rails.

What are your opinions on Agile software development?

Agile is very team-oriented, collaborative, and efficient. It's more flexible for everyone(developer/customer), and quality results are produced faster. Agile requires direct access to the customer, which makes it especially appropriate for in-house development. 

TDD or BDD?

BDD all the way!

What are you looking for in a job?

I've been hoping to work on a production rails application for a few months, but rails internships are slim pickins in the Orange County area. I would like to gain some experience working collaboratively on a large rails application. Most importantly, I aim to sharpen my ruby & rails skills by working with an established team.

I would like to become a better programmer through surrounding myself with professionals in the field. I would like to focus more on code and less on the idiosyncrasies of php or java (or whatever other language).

Are you legal to work in the US?

Yes.

When can you start?

Immediately.
