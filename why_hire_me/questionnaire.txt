What are your opinions on Agile software development?
Agile is a theory, that can help speed things up in bigger size teams and organizations. In startups (which is where I have most experience), things move really fast and a lot of the agile principles have to play out on a much shorter time frame. In this case, agile boils down to internal communicating in order to prioritize and then monitoring the results of what you deploy so you can quickly iterate. In bigger/more establed orgs, there's more processes that are introduced because you have time. Estimating, sprint planning, doing retros are all good practices that help everyone get work done and stay on the same page.

TDD or BDD?
TDD is what I have most experience with. It's good if you can get a large percentage of your code-based covered with tests. Then it's very easy to catch bugs when working. BDD sounds good in theory, but I haven't used it much in practice.

What are you looking for in a job?
Currently, I'm looking for a little bit of a bigger org than I've been in coming from startups. I'd like for the software solutions to be in a field that I'm interested in.

I'd like to work with a team that's interested in software, and wants to be creative and innovative with our software solutions that we build.
